            2. EDUCATION INFORMATION ON RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL GAMEPLAY<br>
            1. Principles of Gameplay<br>
            1. Randomness: Remember that game round outcomes are completely random. Results cannot be predicted and are independent of past or future outcomes.<br>
            2. Return to Player (RTP): This is the average return on the winnings and prizes over the lifetime of a slot-type game. I.e., if a slot type has an 8% advantage, then the average RTP will be 92%.<br>
            3. Advantage: All casino-type games are designed with a slight advantage that favors the operator.<br>
            2. Common Misconceptions<br>
            1. &ldquo;I'm due for a win&rdquo; - You cannot predict when you're going to win. All outcomes are random.<br>
            2. &ldquo;I always win with my lucky charm and pre-game ritual&rdquo; - Although they might be fun, charms and rituals don't affect your chances of winning. All outcomes are random.<br>
            3. &ldquo;The longer I play, the more chance I'll win&rdquo; - Time spent has no effect on your chances of winning. All outcomes are random.<br>
            4. &ldquo;These Games have been rigged&rdquo; - The Random Number Generator (RNG)&#160;used in all Website games has been independently certified by an independent test lab, who confirmed that the RNG uses a well-known algorithm to generate random numbers. The numbers generated by the RNG have passed Marsaglia's &quot;diehard&quot; tests for statistical randomness. The independent test lab/s have found that number sequences are unpredictable, non-repeatable, and uniformly distributed.<br>
            3. Tips for Safe Gameplay<br>
            1. Avoid gameplay while upset or emotional.<br>
            2. Take frequent breaks during your gameplay sessions.<br>
            3. Avoid gameplay while intoxicated.<br>
            4. Avoid canceling redemptions.<br>
            5. Remember that gameplay is only a form of entertainment, it should not be seen as a source of income or an escape from reality.<br>
            6. Purchase only with money that you can afford to spend.<br>
            7. Set a budget and don't go over it.<br>
            8. Set a time limit before playing.<br>
            9. Understand how games work before playing and remember that the results are random.<br>
            10. Never let gameplay affect your employment, relationships, health or commitments.<br>
